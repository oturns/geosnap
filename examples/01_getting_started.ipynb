    "The geosnap package is designed for researchers in the Urban Studies who are interested in exploring, modeling, and analyzing the social and spatial dynamics of neighborhoods. Although neighborhoods are critically important for human development and public policy, they present a variety of novel challenges for quantitative researchers. Since there is no accepted definition of \"neighborhood,\" most quantitative studies involving [neighborhood effects](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114) or [neighborhood dynamics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119000921818) use census data and their administrative boundaries to define spatial areas that reasonably approximate neighborhoods. In the U.S., this typically means using census tracts, since they have a relatively small spatial footprint and a wide variety of variables are tabulated at that scale. For this reason, geosnap's first release is targeted at researchers working with US Census tract data. This allows the software to make available a wide variety of data and commonly-used variables with minimal interaction from the end-user. Later releases will expand functionality to other geographies and data sources.  \n",

    "You can access geosnap's data dictionary to get a sense of the variables available for analysis, the census tabulations from which they are derived, and the nomenclature they use. It's available as a pandas DataFrame under `geosnap.data`. Variables pertaining to counts are prefixed with `n_` whereas percentages are prefixed with `p_`"
