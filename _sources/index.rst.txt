The Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

`geosnap` makes it easier to explore, model, analyze, and visualize the social and spatial dynamics
of neighborhoods. It provides a suite of tools for creating socio-spatial
datasets, harmonizing those datasets into consistent set of time-static boundaries,
modeling bespoke neighborhoods and prototypical neighborhood types, and modeling
neighborhood change using classic and spatial statistical methods.
It also provides a set of static and interactive visualization tools to help you display
and understand the critical information at each step of the process.

`geosnap` comes packed with 30 years of census data, thanks to `quilt <https://quiltdata.com/>`_, so you
can get started modeling neighborhoods in the U.S. immediately.
But youâ€™re not just limited to the data provided with the package. `geosnap`
works with any data you provide, any place in the world.


This site holds the `API documentation <https://oturns.github.io/geosnap/api.html>`_. For a more applied walkthrough focused on the use 
of geosnap in practice, see the `User Guide <https://oturns.github.io/geosnap-guide>`_ instead
